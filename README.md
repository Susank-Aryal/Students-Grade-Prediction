# Students-Grade-Prediction
Final Year Dissertation On student's Grade prediction submitted to university of Northampton

In respect to the major aims of this study, which is to propose an appropriate machine learning 
algorithm for successful prediction of student’s future grade the other aims are to

--> Perform an exploratory data analysis in order to detect missing values, outliers, 
understanding the structure of data, estimating parameters and figuring out the margins of 
error.

--> Present an easy to read and access analyze visualization dashboard after performing the 
exploratory data analysis.

--> Identify the best fitting model for the student grade prediction by experimenting with 
different supervised and unsupervised models using different machine learning algorithms.

--> Prepare a draft of a grade prediction and analysis system which can act as an example for 
a targeted group of institutes and colleges on how the student’s data can be utilized to 
improve their performance and interaction further.

In relation to the main objective of predicting the future grade of the students referring to their past 
performance these are the other objectives.

--> Research on the various models available for the prediction of the student’s grade

--> Complete the data acquisition, data cleaning and different data-preprocessing activities to 
prepare a visualization dashboard and a correct dataset for the model

--> To identify the important features for the prediction of student’s grade

--> To experiment supervised and unsupervised machine learning models like SVM, Linear 
regression, K-nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Clustering (Hierarchical clustering) for 
predicting future student performance

--> To perform research and discover the best ways for the evaluation of the model

--> To purpose of the best machine learning algorithm for predicting a student's grade
